We would like to thank the members of the Abramovitch Lab for helpful discussions and critical
assessment/bug identification within the workflow. We would also like to thank the developers
and contributors of Python, Trimmomatic, FastQC, Bowtie, HTSeq, and edgeR; without these
individuals, SPARTA would not be possible. Finally, we would like to thank you, the user, 
for utilizing the workflow and making it better.
